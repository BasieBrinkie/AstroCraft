		"- Now you need to slab down an adjoining block of cobblestone.",
		"- In order to start a fire throw pebbles to the block of cobblestone by left clicking pebbles.",
		"- Once a single log pile burns all adjecent log piles will also start buring.",

		"NOTE: Be sure that every side including the top is covered once the fire is lit otherwise all piles will just burn up instead of giving coal.",

		"TIP: You can transform multiple blocks of log piles at once by placing multiple adjecent log piles. Then cover all log piles with a block of cobblestone on the top except for the one that needs to be lit by pebbles."
