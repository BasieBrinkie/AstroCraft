setChunkGeneratorDefinition:
    Notes:
        Sets the ChunkGeneratorDefinition object for the dimension and returns it, so functions can be called on it. The same functions that can be called in a chunkgenerators script, can be called on this object. Documentation can be found in documentation/chunkgenerators/ChunkGenerator.txt

setChunkGeneratorDefinition:
    Notes:
        Sets the ChunkGeneratorDefinition object for the dimension to the provided type and returns it, so functions can be called on it. The same functions that can be called in a chunkgenerators script, can be called on this object. Documentation can be found in documentation/chunkgenerators

setChunkGeneratorDefinition:
    Arguments:
        ChunkGeneratorDefinition
    Usage:
        definition
    Notes:
        Sets the ChunkGeneratorDefinition for the dimension to the provided one.

addBlockReplacement:
    Notes:
        Adds a BlockReplacement to the dimension and returns it, so functions can be run on it. The same functions that can be called in a blockreplacement script, can be called on this object. Documentation can be found in documentation/blockreplacements

addBlockReplacement:
    Arguments:
        String
    Usage:
        BlockReplacement type
