# MCW and OTG+ completely reimplemented CustomStructure, check the MCW/OTG+ documentation for more information.

# A short description of this BO3 object
Description: This BO3 was converted from a schematic using OTGEdit. The author and description information of the schematic could not be found. If you know who the author of the schematic is then please add this information.

# The BO3 version, don't change this! It can be used by external applications to do a version check.
Version: 3

# The settings mode, WriteAll, WriteWithoutComments or WriteDisable. See WorldConfig.

# To optimise this BO3 for faster loading times you can use Notepad++ to find/replace comments and abbreviate things.
# Notepad++ find/replace with regex:

# Entity() spawns an entity instead of a block. The entity is spawned only once when the BO3 is spawned.
# Entities are persistent by default so they don't de-spawn when no player is near, they are only unloaded.
# Usage: Entity(x,y,z,mobName,groupSize,NameTagOrNBTFileName) or Entity(x,y,z,mobName,groupSize)
# Use /tc entities or /otg entities to get a list of entities that can be used as mobName, this includes entities added by other mods.
# NameTagOrNBTFileName can be either a nametag for the mob or an nbt file (such as mymobinfo.nbt or mymobinfo.txt).
# When using a text file you can use the same mob spawning parameters used with the /summon command to equip the
# entity and give it custom attributes etc. You can copy the DATA part of a summon command including surrounding
# curly braces to a .txt file, for instance for: "/summon Skeleton x y z {DATA}"

# +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ #
#######################################################################

# Require a condition at a certain location in order for the BO3 to be spawned.
# BlockCheck(x,y,z,BlockName[,BlockName[,...]]) - one of the blocks must be at the location
# BlockCheckNot(x,y,z,BlockName[,BlockName[,...]]) - all the blocks must not be at the location
# LightCheck(x,y,z,minLightLevel,maxLightLevel) - light must be between min and max (inclusive)

# You can use "Solid" as a BlockName for matching all solid blocks or "All" to match all blocks that aren't air.

# Examples:
#   BlockCheck(0,-1,0,GRASS,DIRT)  Require grass or dirt just below the object
#   BlockCheck(0,-1,0,Solid)       Require any solid block just below the object
#   BlockCheck(0,-1,0,WOOL)        Require any type of wool just below the object
#   BlockCheck(0,-1,0,WOOL:0)      Require white wool just below the object
#   BlockCheckNot(0,-1,0,WOOL:0)   Require that there is no white wool below the object
#   LightCheck(0,0,0,0,PACKED_ICE)          Require almost complete darkness just below the object
