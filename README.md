# AstroCraft
A Minecraft modpack based around spacetravel
## Pack description
Escape the asteroid field with your improvised ramshackle rocket and start building a space station. This space station will permanently be your home to the very end of the pack. In your space station, you'll have to fight the harsh environment by constantly creating oxygen (You can't wear your space suit for a long time due to the radiation emitted by the suit). Visit interesting planets with each unique materials, mobs and structures. Learn about the extinct species from the desolate and abandoned planets through the books of lore in the pack. Quests are also a big part of the pack. All quests are separated into professions that can be unlocked through collecting research points. Finish all studies for all professions and built a self-sustaining space station with lots of cargo rockets docking with rare resources from other planets and with advanced tech-infused plant breeding techniques.    

## Lore
You find yourself waking up in deep space surrounded by a countless amount of asteroids. The last thing you remember was your crewmembers putting you asleep in a cryo-chamber after a mining mission. After a short panic attack, you grab yourself together in order to survive. Fortunately, the asteroids all around you proved to be very rich on oxygen. A new question arises: "How can I turn this worthless space debris and rocks into breathable oxygen?". 
   This pack challenges you to fight against the harsh space environment, be intuitive and create a  space station. Use this space station to your advantage. You'll, for example, be able to travel to the outer edges of the Minecraft universe and collect new materials with unique properties.
More to come!

This project needs lots of work in order to make it playable.
