# AstroCraft
A Minecraft 1.12.2 modpack based around space-travel. It focuses early game around basic blocks from advanced-rocketry. This pack starts off in a asteroid dimension and challenges you to fight against the harsh space environment, be intuitive and create a space station.
With this space station you'll visit planets and create bases to gather/process resources and send them off to your spaceship. You'll eventually be able to travel to the outer edges of the Minecraft universe and collect new materials with unique properties.
## Pack description
Escape the asteroid field with your improvised ramshackle rocket and start building a space station. This space station will permanently be your home to the very end of the pack. In your space station, you'll have to fight the harsh environment by constantly creating oxygen. Visit interesting planets with each unique materials, mobs and structures. Learn about the extinct species from the desolate and abandoned planets through the books of lore in the pack. 
For players that want a lot of guidance there are quests. All items are staged so you can only see what you have unlocked so far. By completing the quests, you will work towards a self-sustaining space station with lots of cargo rockets docking with rare resources from other planets and with advanced tech-infused plant breeding techniques.
The main features of the pack:
- Space station home base
- Asteroid mining
- Halo world
- Planet bound items
- Base creation on nearly every planet
- Extensive mod integration for recipes
- Non-linear progression line
- Play with or without gamestages
- Low repetitive grind
This pack has literally every recipe reworked and tweaked such that all mods work together. For example, the early game in the asteroids fields requires you to use Sky Resources 2, Ex Nihilo Creatio and Factorytech all together to make low tier metals. Shortly after making and using these machines you are quickly given the opportunity where you could automate/increase the efficiency of the machines.
## Staging/Questing system
All items in the mudpack are staged, this means at the beginning you will have no JEI clutter. If you prefer to play without gamestages you can do so at the very start. The modpack entails a total of XXX quests to guide you through each mod and show you the progression line was intended.
## Unique Mechanics
 One unique mechanic is whenever you are at a space station you cannot wear a space suit while interacting with machines. This is done to encourage players to create an oxygen distribution system so you donâ€™t have to wear a space suit inside your space station. You can still interact with inventories to retrieve blocks and expand your space station.
Common metals such as iron, steel, copper and more have multiple tiers. Each tier has its own progression line and higher tier materials can often also be used in recipes that require lower tier materials.
Choose your own starting world! When you spawn you will be presented with the following starting worlds:
- Asteroids Field (Sky-Block)
- Glacidus 	 (Scavenging)
- Aquarius-66B 	 (Sea-Block)
#### Asteroids Field:
Make use of the surrounding resourceful asteroids around you. You will gather ores and start an early game production line to supply essential building blocks to your space station. You start off with a space suit filled with 4 hours of oxygen and a broken rocket with some handy items. There is not a lot of room for errors as you need to complete your first oxygen generation contraption within 4 hours.
#### Glacidus:
It appears that the mining ship and its drones have crashed on this planet. Conveniently there is wreckage that can be salvaged for parts. Lots of ores where already processed by the mining drones with saves a lot of time. The planet has a barren but breathable atmosphere and is full of underground life. You will learn how to use the habitants to farm items and it appears some flowers have special properties. You will start to learn the basics of Botania.
#### Aquarius-66B:
Water is a scarce resource, and this planet could very well be your first source. The goal is to build an underwater base and build a water supply for your space station. You get items from the ocean life and by filtering water in different ways. 
## Lore Preview
You find yourself waking up in deep space surrounded by a countless number of asteroids. The last thing you remember was your crewmembers putting you asleep in a cryo-chamber after a mining mission. After a short panic attack, you grab yourself together in order to survive. Fortunately, the asteroids all around you proved to be very rich on oxygen. A new question arises: "How can I turn this worthless space debris and rocks into breathable oxygen?".
